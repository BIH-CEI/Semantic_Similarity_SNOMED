=== Mapping Difficulty Index (MDI) Analysis ===

Formula: MDI = 0.5*disagreement + 0.4*semantic_disagreement + 0.1*diversity

Items analyzed: 480
Mean MDI: 0.147
Median MDI: 0.016

Difficulty categories:
  Easy (high agreement, close concepts): 255 (53.1%)
  Moderate (some disagreement, related concepts): 120 (25.0%)
  Difficult (divergent codes, semantic distance): 105 (21.9%)

Gap analysis candidates (MDI >= 0.5): 12
Ready for implementation (MDI < 0.1): 255

Key findings:
- Missing values are NOT correlated with difficulty (r=-0.026)
- Semantic disagreement is strongest indicator (r=0.640 with disagreement)
- High MDI items should be reviewed for BfArM gap submission
- Low MDI items are ready for MII-Onko implementation
