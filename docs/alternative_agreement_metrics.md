# Alternative Agreement Metrics for SNOMED CT Mapping

## The Problem
Standard agreement metrics (Cohen's Kappa, Krippendorff's Alpha) assume:
- All categories are equally valid for all items
- All disagreements are equally bad

For SNOMED CT this is wrong because:
- Only specific codes are appropriate for each clinical concept
- Disagreements have varying semantic distances

## Alternative Metrics

### 1. **Semantic Krippendorff's Alpha** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**What it is**: Krippendorff's Alpha using SNOMED graph distances as the metric

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Accounts for semantic similarity
- ✅ Partial credit for close concepts
- ✅ Uses full SNOMED hierarchy
- ✅ Well-established in literature
- ✅ Addresses your concern about inappropriate baselines

**Formula**:
```
α = 1 - (D_observed / D_expected)

where distance(c1, c2) = shortest_path(c1, c2) in SNOMED graph
```

**Why it's best for your case**:
- If mappers choose from different domains (diagnosis vs location), distance is LARGE
- If mappers choose similar concepts, distance is SMALL
- Expected disagreement accounts for the full graph structure

### 2. **Hierarchical Agreement Coefficient (Wu & Palmer similarity)**
**What it is**: Agreement weighted by taxonomic similarity

**Formula**:
```
similarity(c1, c2) = 2 × depth(LCA) / (depth(c1) + depth(c2))

where LCA = Lowest Common Ancestor
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Uses taxonomy structure
- ✅ Interpretable (0-1 scale)
- ✅ Fast to compute

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Only considers IS-A hierarchy
- ❌ Doesn't account for chance agreement
- ❌ Not a standard reliability metric

---

### 3. **Information-Theoretic Approach (Resnik)**
**What it is**: Agreement based on information content

**Formula**:
```
similarity(c1, c2) = -log(P(LCA))

where P(LCA) = probability of using the LCA concept
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Accounts for concept specificity
- ✅ Rare concepts get more weight

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Requires corpus statistics
- ❌ Complex interpretation
- ❌ Not standardized for inter-rater reliability

---

### 4. **Gwet's AC (Agreement Coefficient)**
**What it is**: Alternative to Kappa that's less affected by prevalence

**Advantages**:
- ✅ More stable than Kappa with unbalanced categories
- ✅ Well-established

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Still nominal (no semantic weighting)
- ❌ Doesn't solve the hierarchy problem

---

### 5. **Custom: Weighted Agreement Score**
**What it is**: Design your own metric

**Example**:
```python
def weighted_agreement(c1, c2, graph):
    if c1 == c2:
        return 1.0
    dist = shortest_path(graph, c1, c2)
    return max(0, 1 - dist/MAX_DISTANCE)

overall_agreement = mean([weighted_agreement(c1, c2) for all pairs])
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Can design for specific needs

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Not standardized
- ❌ Hard to compare with other studies
- ❌ Requires justification

## Recommendation for Your Study

### Primary Metric: **Semantic Krippendorff's Alpha**

Report THREE values:

1. **Standard (Nominal) Alpha**: 0.7634
   - Shows raw agreement
   - Comparable to other inter-rater studies

2. **Semantic Alpha (IS-A only)**: [to be calculated]
   - Uses IS-A hierarchy distances
   - Shows agreement accounting for taxonomic similarity

3. **Semantic Alpha (Full Relations)**: [to be calculated]
   - Uses ALL SNOMED relationships
   - Highest fidelity to SNOMED structure

### Why This Addresses Your Concern

The semantic alpha **implicitly uses the full SNOMED space** because:

- Graph distance uses ALL concepts in the path
- A diagnosis code and a body structure code are ~20-30 hops apart
- This is nearly the maximum distance (approaching nominal disagreement)
- So inappropriate code pairs get full penalty
- But semantically close pairs get partial credit

### For Your SNOMED Expo Presentation

**Key Message**:
"Standard alpha treats all disagreements equally. But when mapping to SNOMED CT,
a disagreement between two specific cancer diagnoses is very different from
choosing a diagnosis code vs. a body structure code. Semantic alpha accounts for
this by weighting disagreements by their graph distance, naturally handling the
371,737-concept space."

## Implementation

The script `recalculate_krippendorff_with_details.py` calculates all three alphas
and outputs intermediate matrices for verification.
